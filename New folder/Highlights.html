                    books on Lifeguard and First Aids lessons, and with the coordination and supervision of the Gym

                    During my military service, back in 2017-2018, I was stationed at a small camp and was assigned to
                    be in
                    charge of 12 soldiers. As my time was coming to an end, my Captain asked my Commander to honorary
                    promote
                    me as Lance Corporal.

                    From 2015 to 2017 i was actively in a band called <i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/decode21"
                            target="_blank">Decode</a></i>, it was a cover band playing Classic,
                    Alternative and Hard Rock songs live. It was by that time that I became an insane guitarist, when I
                    acquired the knowledge of the 4 cords that, to this day, know.
